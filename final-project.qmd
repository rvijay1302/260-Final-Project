## 2
# Start with regression model from pset 8, split into age groups based comparable trends. Fit these models and use it to predict mortality.

## 3
# Yearly mortality plot shows excess deaths 2002 - 2008. Remove these years, refit models, and compare predictions. Also, explore weekly effect by splitting by week, refit these models, and compare predictions.

## 4
# Comment on final model, plot excess deaths (related to hurricane).

## 5
# Combine excessmort and NYT data, compute differences, plot stuff.
