# Assessing Excess Mortality in Puerto Rico During Hurricane Maria

### Abstract

On September 20, 2017, the \[adjective\] tropical cyclone Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico's southeast coast. Months after the hurricane the official death toll reported by the U.S.-backed Puerto Rican government remained stubbornly below 100, but later analysis has estimated the death toll to be as much as 5,000. This project attempts to statistically analyze Puerto Rico's Department of Health Demographic Registry mortality data from 2002 to 2017 to identify excess mortality during Hurricane Maria. We begin by examining population and mortality trends across age and sex groups, statistically model excess mortality in 2017 during Hurricane Maria as compared to typical mortality rates, and compare results and findings to results generated by the New York Times as gathered from the Puerto Rico Department of Health. We identify \[results\]. We finally reflect on the value of rigorous data analysis during natural disasters with particular regard to the political aims of \[something\].

### Introduction

Hurricane Maria made

-   Maria

-   

Fit a linear regression model regressing age category and sex on observed death rate

Use predict to generate predicted rates

Compare predicted rates with observed rates

Compare to NYT

### Methods

### Results

### Discussion

-   Hurricane Maria killed lots of people but initially people said it didn't

-   Eventually the govt did recognize the really bad impact of the storm

-   Shows the power and importance of good data analysts
